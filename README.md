# Reinforcement-Learning

## Objectives

### Objective 1 ###
* Read through an [introduction to reinforcement learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/getting-ready-for-ai-based-gaming-agents-overview-of-open-source-reinforcement-learning-platforms/) to get an idea of how reinforcement learning works

    * **Comments** <br>
    Was not particularly helpful, gave an extremely simple overview of reinforcement learning. (i.e agent gets an observation from the environment -> agent peforms and action -> may or may not get a reward -> feedback to agent -> cycle restarts)

### Objective 2 ###
* Read through a [beginners guide to reinforcement learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-implementation/) to go through some examples of reinforcement learning

    * **Comments** <br>
    Website contained code example of implementing a Deep Q-learning algorithm to train an agent to play cartpole.
    My own implementation in the carpole_deepQlearning.py file. The implementation was straightfoward, however I feel as if some of the important concepts were really explained. For example the article did not really explain how rewards were being given to the agent.
    <br>
    I probably need to take a look at the keras documenation to see exactly what I have implemented.
    <br>
    Overall this article is too high level for me to be able to really learn anything concrete from it. It gave me a very hazy high-level understanding of reinforcement learning. All I did was use a library.

    * **Unanswered Questions/Tasks** <br>
        - [ ] Look at Keras documentation
        - [ ] Take a look at multiagent reinforcement learning. This [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-27645-3_14) titled: Game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning may be interesting.
        - [ ] Need to improve fundamental understanding of how reinforcement learning works


    * **Interesting Insights!** <br>
        * Game theory and multiagent reinforcement learning (the idea of multiple agents being trained in the same environment) may be an interesting topic to learn more about.
        * Other areas RL is being applied to
            * Game theory and multi-agent interaction
            * Robotics
            * Computer networks
            * Vehicular navigation
            * Medicine
            * Industrial Logic

### Object 3 ###
* Start reading through [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf) to improve basic understanding on reinforcement learning.

    * Reading Introduction
        * Gives an introduction to reinforcement learning, gives motivation on its importance, some basic history.
        * Describes the _policy_, _reward signal_, _value function_, and a _model_ of the environment.
            * _Policy_: learning agents way of behaving at a given time. A mapping of perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken in those states. In general, policies may be stochastic.
