# Reinforcement-Learning

## Objectives

* Read through an [introduction to reinforcement learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/getting-ready-for-ai-based-gaming-agents-overview-of-open-source-reinforcement-learning-platforms/) to get an idea of how reinforcement learning works

**Comments**
Was not particularly helpful, gave an extremely simple overview of reinforcement learning. (i.e agent gets an observation from the environment -> agent peforms and action -> may or may not get a reward -> feedback to agent -> cycle restarts)


* Read through a [beginners guide to reinforcement learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-implementation/
) to go through some examples of reinforcement learning
